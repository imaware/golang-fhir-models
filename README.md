# Golang FHIR Models

This repository contains a FHIRÂ® R4 models for Go. The models consist of Go structs for each resource and data type. The structs are suitable for JSON encoding/decoding. 

## Features

* resources implement the [Marshaler][1] interface
* unmarshal functions are provided for every resource
* enums are provided for every ValueSet used in a [required binding][2], has a computer friendly name and refers only to one CodeSystem
* enums implement `Code()`, `Display()` and `Definition()` methods

## Usage

In your project, import `github.com/imaware/golang-fhir-models/fhir-models/fhir` and you are done.

## TODOs

* [Support Polymorphic Data Elements](https://github.com/imaware/golang-fhir-models/issues/1)
* [Support ValueSets Referring to Multiple CodeSystems](https://github.com/imaware/golang-fhir-models/issues/2)

## Develop

This repository contains two Go modules, the generated models itself and the generator. Both modules use `go generate` to generate the FHIR models. For `go generate` to work, you have to install the generator first. To do that, run `go install` in the `fhir-models-gen` directory. After that, you can regenerate the FHIR Models under `fhir-models` and the subset of FHIR models under `fhir-models-gen`.
